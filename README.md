# WatchNext API for connecting MongoDB and Server
In order to run this server you need a connection to a mongo db database. Please fill in the username, password, and database/collection name in the [development.config.js](./development.config.js) file.
You also must run npm install to get the required packages.

Once both of those are done, simply call node server.js in the root directory to get a live server running. For development purposes it is also suggested to install and use nodemon for running the server. This way the server will restart automatically and update any changes made when you save a modified file.
